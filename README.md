# Fin-Tech_Challenge_21_Kasei_Crowdsale

After waiting for years and passing several tests, you were selected by the Martian Aerospace Agency to be part of the first human colony on Mars. As a prominent fintech professional, you were chosen to lead a project to develop a monetary system for the new Mars colony. You have decided to base this new monetary system on blockchain technology, and to define a new cryptocurrency called **KaseiCoin**. (“Kasei” means “Mars” in Japanese.)

KaseiCoin will be a fungible token that is ERC-20 compliant. You will launch a crowdsale that will allow people who are moving to Mars to convert their earthling money to KaseiCoin.
